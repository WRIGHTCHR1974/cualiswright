	<h1>Assignment 1 - Chris Wright - LSC555</h1>

	<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>The <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/" target="_blank">National Center for 	Education Statistics (NCES)</a> has been integral to the federal government 	since 1867. NCES is the primary statistic-gathering area within the Department 	of Education.</p> 

	<p>As one of the <a href="https://www.statspolicy.gov/about/" 	target="_blank">16 Recognized Statistical Agencies</a>, NCES, a non-partisan NGO, has <b><i><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2020-title44/html/USCODE-2020-title44-chap35-subchapIII-partA-sec3563.htm" target="_blank">four responsibilities established by law:</a></i></b></p>

	<table>
		 <tr>

    			<th>Produce and disseminate statistical information</th>

    			<th>Conduct credible statistical activities</th>

    			<th>Conduct objective statistical activities</th>		

			<th>Protect the trust of information and confidentiality, and maintain exclusive use of their stats.</th>

  		</tr>

	<h2>Users</h2>

	<p>All users seek education information, but the data is widely used in many 	areas. Main seekers of the data include government and state policymakers, 	education researchers, those who help establish data infrastructures (K-12, 	higher education, government), and those who look to leverage the many reports 	that are made available publicly.  Along with reports, the website also offers 	a plethora of resources for those seeking funding to support their research in 	topic areas such as:</p>

		<li>Educational Equity

		<li>Disabilities

		<li>Early Childhood Education

		<li><a href="https://ies.ed.gov/funding/grants/" target="_blank">As well as others </a></li>


	<h2>Content of Website</h2>

	<p>In addition to ways to explore funding opportunities, the website offers explanations on the purpose of NCES and how their work can be used across the landscape of education. NCES collects and makes available longitudinal data across federal and state to provide the best assessments of our educational system. One program in particular that is a central part of their data collection is to 	collect data for the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), which services all institutions of higher learning to provide a common set of data for statistic gathering and analysis. Along with links to IPEDS, thereâ€™s information on the Common Core of Data and other studies. 



<h2>Observations and Unique Features</h2>

	<p>In just a month, NCES faces its biggest challenge. With the current environment of budget cuts and spending less on research, it will impact the availability and quality of data.  NCES is uniquely positioned to provide more connections regarding different aspects of education data because of its breadth and depth of research. Because of the federal mandate established by law, it would not be easy to dissolve the services offered fully. What will remain of the Center will come in time, and it will be reshaped based on who controls the government. 



<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<ol>

	<li><b>Keep data transfer simple</b> - While the website is full of information, instead of the cuts that are coming, they can create ways to offer savings by updating data systems to be more cost-effective and efficient. Modernizing the interface to retrieve the data or using technology such as AI to support searching for data and research will simplify how users find answers.</li><br>



<li><b>When in doubt, partner</b> - I do think that partnerships will drastically improve support for NCES

as they continue to develop and improve partnerships with leading education associations and other stakeholders. Increasing support for participation in NCES studies will ensure they have a ready and able body of partners that will also need their data.</li><br>



<li><b>Do what they do best, do it for the kids!</b> - Perhaps another area that they can highlight is all the work they are doing to support K-12 research. The website should focus on what they can control (research and studies) and continue to support better education for children.</li>
